                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                      No. Police escort is a conditional inclusion and only applies if explicitly written on your package page and/or voucher.

                      Does police escort guarantee faster travel times?

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                      No. Safety always overrides speed. Escort helps with coordination but does not override road laws, weather limits, or park closures.
